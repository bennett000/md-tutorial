## Workflow

If you're used to writing in a word processor - like Writer, Pages, or Word,
then this will be a bit of an adjustment.

In a traditional word processor the user is presented with a document that *is*
the end result.  Markdown presents the user with plain text that *can* be the
end result, or that text can be put through a post processor, and made pretty.

Markdown's approach has numerous strengths.  Markdown is very fast to write,
since simple text *truly* is *what you see is what you get*.  This document
itself is proof that post processing can be simple, and automatic.

Markdown's post processors almost always produce [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
which is the markup language that drives the world wide web.  There are also
programs that will transpose markdown to other markups, like wiki, or bbcodes.
