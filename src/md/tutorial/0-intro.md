## What is markdown?

Markdown is a simple tool that that makes it fun, and easy to write well
formatted text that is transportable.  If you're familiar with wiki markup, or
bbcodes, you can think of markdown as a *lighter* version of those tools.

To a certain extent markdown simply enforces conventions, like blank lines mean
new paragraphs, or that `*` denotes a bullet point.  It's really that simple.

This document was written in markdown.

If you want to play with markdown, simply tap ["Sandbox"](#/sandbox) at any
time - the tutorial can, and will wait for you.

Also feel free to fiddle with elements of the tutorial as we go along, you
can always revert the page to defaults
