## Basics - Headings

Headings separate documents into logical blocks.  Typically there will be a
primary title at the top of the document that's the largest.  There are two
ways to mark this down.

    # Header 1 (<h1></h1>)

or

    Header 1 (<h1></h1>)
    ====================

The hash notation is easy to remember, for each sub heading, just add a hash!

    # Header 1 (<h1></h1>)

    ## Header 2 (<h2></h2>)

    ### Header 2 (<h3></h3>)

etc...
