md-tutorial todo
================

* Make scripts/test-server.js system agnostic
* Find someone with artistic skill to make icons
* Find someone with design skill for scss/sass
* Setup some watchers to automate compilation, bootstrapping, etc
* Sort out angular minification - the markdown wrapper stuff is horrible right
now

## Flags panel

* icon img/icons/wrench.png

Should allow for toggling/editing of program flags - for advanced users, and
people who want to tinker.

## Local Storage Module

* window.localStorage can be leveraged to provide document support.  I have,
and angular wrapper lined up for this.
* localStorage will also be used to mark preferences

## Layouts

* Mobile telephone layouts (portrait/landscape)
* Ideas for portrait layout
  * Tuck menu items into collapsable icon (img/icons/menu.svg)
  * Add top right toggle icon (img/icons/loop-circular.svg) - flips between
  textarea/rendered output???
* Themes.  There's still a lot to be sorted out for this
