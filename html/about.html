    <h2>md-tutorial</h2>
    This project was started in response to Atwood's
    [request](http://blog.codinghorror.com/toward-a-better-markdown-tutorial/)
    for a better markdown tutorial. I do not know if this project is a better
    tutorial, but I do know it is fun to have a nice little project to work on.

    <h2>Development Status</h2>
    This software, and tutorial are currently in a "pre-release" status - if
    you're using this, please be aware that this is very much a work in
    progress.  Who am I kidding, nobody reads about pages...
