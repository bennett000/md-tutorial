Markdown Tutorial
=================

## Build Environment

The project aims to have as system neutral a build process as possible,
nevertheless there are a few external dependencies, and other local settings
that need to be accounted for.  This file `md-tutorial/project-config.template`
can be copied to `md-tutorial/project-config` and tuned accordingly.  This file
should be ignored by git.

For more information about dependencies see `md-tutorial/DEPENDENCIES.md`
