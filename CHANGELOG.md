## Notes

### Second Day

* Last night (this morning) a basic proof of concept was sort of achieved, with
respect to the fact that there is now a sandbox mode.

* I've been writing really sloppy TypeScript, with respect to caring about
types.  This is obviously hilarious.  The choice of using TypeScript for this
project was not about mediocre type safety, it was about sugar; I am very happy
that TypeScript lets me write so "loose".  Nothing against types, I am a fan, I
just find them less useful this close to the UI.

* Speaking of Types, everything is compiling fine, and linting fine, but
WebStorm is a red underlined mess - still *not* confident with my understanding
of TypeScript's modules.  Oops.

### First Day

* Goal of accomplishing anything on a Friday night failed - went to bed early
