Markdown Tutorial Change Log
============================

## Notes

### Fifth Day

* Storage system spec started
* e2e tests fixed up with page objects
* build process streamlined for Git Hub pages

### Fourth Day

* Built to gh-pages - "local testing" of build is broken needs fixing
* Got a handle on a basic layout for tablet/desktop
* Roughed in some concepts for the tutorial


### Third Day

* Found MIT licensed icons that will be useful for buttons
* Started to get a handle on scss, and rudimentary "responsive" layout
* R&D'd custom themes.  Technical details seem easy - name spacing CSS not so
much.  Pursuing something like an iFrame might work with that - but then there
are mobile issue.
* Likely my last commits for a little while - it's Monday!

### Second Day

* Last night (this morning) a basic proof of concept was sort of achieved, with
respect to the fact that there is now a sandbox mode.

* I've been writing really sloppy TypeScript, with respect to caring about
types.  This is obviously hilarious.  The choice of using TypeScript for this
project was not about mediocre type safety, it was about sugar; I am very happy
that TypeScript lets me write so "loose".  Nothing against types, I am a fan, I
just find them less useful this close to the UI.

* Speaking of Types, everything is compiling fine, and linting fine, but
WebStorm is a red underlined mess - still *not* confident with my understanding
of TypeScript's modules.  Oops.

### First Day

* Goal of accomplishing anything on a Friday night failed - went to bed early
